<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Latex allergy</h1>
<h3><marquee>Rash may occur within minutes to hours after exposure to a latex product</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">



<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>During an IgE-mediated allergic reaction, your body’s immune system overreacts to a substance (like latex) that isn’t harmful to most people. Your immune system tries to protect you by releasing a chemical called histamine into your bloodstream. Histamine causes symptoms of an allergic reaction. You may experience hives, runny nose and trouble breathing.</p><p>

An allergic reaction to latex can happen when you touch or come into contact with latex products. Your immune system may also react if you breathe in tiny latex particles in the air. You may not have a reaction the first time you’re exposed to latex. With each exposure, your allergic reactions may get worse.</p>

<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Signs of an allergic reaction to latex can be mild or severe. They can appear right after exposure to latex or up to a few hours later. You might not have symptoms the first time you come into contact with latex. Latex allergy symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Skin irritation: Itching, inflammation, redness and swelling appear after skin contact with latex. For example, you may have itchy lips after blowing up a balloon or vaginal irritation after having sex with a partner who used a latex condom.</li><li>
Rash: An itchy rash appears where the latex touched your skin. A latex allergy rash usually occurs within a day after exposure. The rash can spread if it touches skin on other parts of your body. But you can get a rash from other factors, such as using too much hand sanitizer or washing your hands too often.</li><li>
Hives, runny nose and sneezing: Itchy, watery eyes and inflammation around the nose and mouth are common. Eyes may become swollen and red.</li><li>
Trouble breathing: People who have severe allergic reactions may wheeze or have difficulty breathing. In severe cases, anaphylaxis may occur. Anaphylaxis can be fatal. If you or someone you know is having an allergic reaction and can’t breathe, call 911 or go to the emergency room.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>

<p>Your healthcare provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and exposure to latex. You should share information about other allergies you have, including reactions to foods. If you have a family history of allergies, tell your provider.

Your provider may order a blood test to check if you’re allergic to latex. Providers also use a skin prick test to diagnose a latex allergy.</p>

	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>There is no cure for latex allergy. If you are allergic to latex, you should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
Avoid products that contain latex.</li><li>
Tell providers, caregivers, teachers and friends that they’re allergic.</li><li>
Avoid areas where latex may be in the air, such as a hospital room where providers use latex gloves.</li><li>
Talk to your healthcare provider about wearing a medical alert bracelet. In a medical emergency, the bracelet lets others know you’re allergic to latex.</li><li>
If an IgE-mediated allergic reaction to latex is diagnosed, you should carry injectable epinephrine with you. Show caregivers, friends and family members how to give you an injection if you’re having a reaction and can’t inject yourself.</li></ul>
